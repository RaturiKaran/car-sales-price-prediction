## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Data Quality Checks
- Converted categorical variables like `gender` and `country` into numerical format  

### 2. Statistical Summary
- Descriptive statistics to understand feature distribution:

### 3. Visualizations
- Distribution of Car Purchase Amount
- Annual Salary vs Car Purchase Amount
- Correlation Heatmap

**Insights:**
- **Annual Salary** and **Net Worth** have strong positive correlation with car purchase amount.  
- Countries show different average purchase prices.  
- Higher credit card debt slightly correlates with lower car price.  

---

## Machine Learning Model
- **Model Chosen:** Linear Regression / Neural Network 
- **Target Variable:** `car purchase amount`
- **Features Used:** Age, Gender, Country (encoded), Annual Salary, Credit Card Debt, Net Worth

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- RÂ² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

## Results
- The model achieved **high accuracy** in predicting car prices.  
- Key drivers for prediction: **Annual Salary**, **Net Worth**, **Age**.
